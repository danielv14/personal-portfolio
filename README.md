## ‚úçÔ∏è Generate blog post boilerplate

Blog posts require certain **frontmatter** such as the name of a layout template and a date. These values can be cumbersome to fill it in by hand all the time.

Because of this blog posts can be generated with [Hygen](http://www.hygen.io/) through the following `npm script`:

```bash
$ yarn article
```

The ‚òùÔ∏è command will prompt you for a _title_ and _summary_ of the article. The summary is optional for the sake of generating boilerplate.

A `{title}.mdx` file will be generated in `src/pages/blogg/` where the title will be used as filename - also as url since it's a file in a Next.js `pages` directory. The `title` will be **slugified and lowercased** before used as filename.

### üóë Clearing article cache

When generating new articles it is sometimes necessary to clear some local caches, to get the new article to appear when running the application locally. In those cases you simply run `yarn cache:clear` after generating a new article - before serving the application with `yarn dev`. Your newly generated article should now be available locally.

## üë®‚Äçüé® Site theming

Many of this sites stylings that are of a more general character comes from a `theme` object defined in `src/theme/theme.ts`. The `theme` object is built up by different `theme parts` defined inside `src/theme/parts/*.ts`.

The idea is to provide customization of the site's general styling though these theme object parts - and to have a single point of customization that will effect the entire site.

The `theme` object consists of the following parts:

- **breakpoints**: contains scale of string values representing pixel widths for media query breakpoints. Media queries using the mobile-first approach by `min-width` is used in this project - to maintain a mobile-first design.
- **colors**: contains brand colors and a special `themed.light` and `themed.dark` object which represents different themable colors of texts, headings, box shadows that are different depending on light and dark mode.
- **fonts**: contains font families and sizes. The sizing system is `rem` based by the `fonts.sizeBase` pixel value. This means that the entire font size scale can easily be adjusted by simply altering `fonts.sizeBase` value.
- **layout**: contains global layout styles such as site width.
- **spacings**: contains a pre-defined spacing scale.

### CSS variables and dark/light mode

CSS variables are created from the `theme` object in `src/theme/cssVariables.ts`.

CSS variables that are dependant on light or dark mode are processed through a function in `src/theme/setupThemeVariables.ts`. Either the `theme.colors.themed.light` or `theme.colors.themed.dark` object are provided to the function in `src/theme/cssVariables.ts`.

If a `.dark-mode` css class exist on the body element the css variables that are light/dark mode aware will be overridden with values from `theme.colors.themed.dark`
