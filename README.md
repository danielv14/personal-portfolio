## ‚úçÔ∏è Generate blog post boilerplate

Blog posts require certain **frontmatter** such as the name of a layout template and a date. These values can be cumbersome to fill it in by hand all the time.

Because of this blog posts can be generated with [Hygen](http://www.hygen.io/) through the following `npm script`:

```bash
$ yarn article
```

The ‚òùÔ∏è command will prompt you for a _title_ and _summary_ of the article. The summary is optional for the sake of generating boilerplate.

A `{title}.mdx` file will be generated in `src/pages/blogg/` where the title will be used as filename - also as url since it's a file in a Next.js `pages` directory. The `title` will be **slugified and lowercased** before used as filename.
