## ‚úçÔ∏è Generate blog post boilerplate

Blog posts require certain **frontmatter** such as the name of a layout template and a date. These values can be cumbersome to fill it in by hand all the time.

Because of this blog posts can be generated with [Hygen](http://www.hygen.io/) through the following `npm script`:

```bash
$ yarn article
```

The ‚òùÔ∏è command will prompt you for a _title_ and _summary_ of the article. The summary is optional for the sake of generating boilerplate.

A `{title}.mdx` file will be generated in `src/pages/blogg/` where the title will be used as filename - also as url since it's a file in a Next.js `pages` directory. The `title` will be **slugified and lowercased** before used as filename.

### üóë Clearing article cache

When generating new articles it is sometimes necessary to clear some local caches, to get the new article to appear when running the application locally. In those cases you simply run `yarn cache:clear` after generating a new article - before serving the application with `yarn dev`. Your newly generated article should now be available locally.

## üë®‚Äçüé® Site theming

Theming of the site is done with the help of [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/), which is a CSS-in-JS library. In the configuration file `src/theme/theme.config.ts` spacing scales, font families, colors, media queries and more are defined. For more info about how stitches utilizes theming and CSS-in-JS, read and walk through the stitches [documentation](https://stitches.dev/docs/installation).

The `theme` folder also include global css rules and configuration for a css reset based on the work of [Eric A. Meyer](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/).

### Dark theme

A dark theme is configured, with alterations of colors from the main theme. This dark theme is toggled on or off with the help of custom hook, `useDarkMode`. This hook exposes the current theme and a callback function which toggles the classname which represents the dark theme.

If the user is using system wide dark mode, the dark theme will automatically be turned on, with the help of a `(prefers-color-scheme: dark)` media query check.

The dark mode hook will also store the user preference of theme to localStorage to set the theme for next visit.
